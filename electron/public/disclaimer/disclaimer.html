                    Welcome to the Burgil Computer System (<span class="italic">&quot;the System&quot;</span>). By using the System, you agree to comply with the following terms of use, designed to ensure safe and lawful usage of the System, particularly in alignment with emerging regulations such as the <strong>EU AI Act</strong>. This software is intended <strong>only for personal computers</strong> and <strong>not for business or commercial use</strong>. The System assists with personal tasks and workflow automation on individual computers, with additional plugin functionality available from the Plugin Marketplace. These terms govern your access to and usage of the System, including any plugins or code you choose to run.

                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The Burgil Computer System is a software application designed for <strong>personal use</strong> on individual computers. It allows users to run code and integrate third-party APIs, such as OpenAI, but <strong>the System does not include or deploy its own AI tools</strong>. Instead, users provide their own API keys to access external services. As an <strong>open-source</strong> application, users can customize and run it directly from the source code, making it adaptable to individual needs.
                </p>

                <!-- Personal Use and BYO API -->
                <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The System is designed exclusively for <strong>personal use</strong> on <strong>individual computers</strong>. It offers automation tools and integrates with third-party AI services via <strong>bring-your-own-API keys</strong>. Burgil does <strong>not deploy or provide AI models directly</strong>, and users are responsible for their own API usage, ensuring compliance with all relevant legal and ethical guidelines.
                </p>

These risks include, but are not limited to, data breaches, unintended AI bias, or misinterpretation of automated decisions. </p>
                        <p class="text-white mb-4">The System is classified under the EU AI Act as a <strong>minimal-risk</strong> application due to its general-purpose nature but may introduce <strong>limited risks</strong> based on user-provided content.</p>

                <p class="text-white mb-4"> Users may install plugins to extend the functionality of the System. These plugins are either sourced from official or third-party providers. Users must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Verify plugin sources</strong> before installation, as the System does not control or monitor third-party plugins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Take responsibility for any changes</strong> or damages caused by third-party plugins, including potential data breaches or system failures.</li>
