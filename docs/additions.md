# Additions

Here are some additions and enhancements that could make my README even more comprehensive and engaging:

1. **Visuals and Demo Section**:
   - **Screenshots** or **GIFs** showing the UI, hot reload in action, or the plugin interface.
   - An **architecture diagram** showing how different components (hot reload, plugins, window management) work together.

2. **Getting Started Example**:
   - A short example demonstrating a quick setup, like creating a new window with `createWindow` or integrating a sample plugin. This gives new users an immediate, hands-on experience.

3. **Detailed Plugin Section**:
   - Describe each default plugin (`ai-vision-server`, `screenshot-taker`), its purpose, setup, and usage. If plugins require dependencies or configuration, mention those steps here.

4. **Advanced Configuration Options**:
   - Describe optional configurations, like how to modify `tailwind.config.js` for custom themes or tweak TypeScript settings.
   - Instructions for adjusting the hot reload server or any custom configuration options in the framework.

5. **Contributing Guidelines**:
   - Add a section for contributors, detailing setup for development, coding standards, and guidelines on submitting pull requests.

6. **Troubleshooting and FAQ**:
   - A dedicated section for common setup issues, debugging tips, and FAQs, like handling dependencies with Bun, or fixing build errors.

7. **Contact and Support**:
   - Mention any available support channels (e.g., GitHub Issues, a Discord server, or email contact) for users to ask questions or request features.
