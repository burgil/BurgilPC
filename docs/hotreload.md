# Hot Reload

The hot reload system watches both `src` and `public` directories:

- **`src`**: Watches for TypeScript changes and rebuilds.
- **`public`**: Monitors asset updates, instantly refreshing the app view.

The hot reload system simplifies development by allowing real-time updates with minimal configuration. Modify any `public` asset, and the smart hot reload immediately refreshes the UI. Backend changes, including window management code, are live-reloaded as well.
