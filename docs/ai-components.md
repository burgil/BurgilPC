# AI Components - Major Challenges and Solutions

The **AI Vision Server** has tremendous potential for innovation, but its capabilities also raise important ethical and security considerations. To responsibly harness its power, a careful balance must be struck between usability and security. The following are some major challenges and possible strategies for addressing them.

The **AI Vision Server** and related AI files can be found in the `installed-plugins/ai-vision-server` folder, with Python and Node.js scripts for handling AI-based tasks.

## Notice

I believe these plugins currently have the potential to be used for good. however, there are inherent risks involved in allowing the mouse to interact with certain images. And since the user provide those images locally we still can't control or know if the user is using it correctly. The personal computer needs to perform these tasks for casual operations, but in the wrong hands, it could easily be transformed into something harmful. This is a scenario we all want to avoid.

To mitigate these risks, I have paused the development of these plugins until a robust solution is in place. In this README, I will outline some of the ideas I have for addressing these challenges, along with the obstacles we may face along the way.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Q:** How can we effectively moderate the usage of the vision server?

  This is the ultimate question we need to tackle. Finding a balance between functionality and safety will be key.

- **Moderation and Oversight:**  
  **Problem:** Moderating the use of the vision server in a way that protects users while upholding their autonomy is a key issue. Allowing a tool of this power to operate without oversight could lead to misuse in unintended or harmful ways.
  **Solution:** A moderation framework could help ensure safe use, such as:
  - **User Confirmation for AI Actions:** Requiring user consent for each action the AI takes - especially in high-stakes tasks - helps maintain control.
  - **Restrictions:** Implementing risk levels to control access in prohibited scenarios can effectively mitigate misuse.
  - **Detailed Documentation and User Guidelines:** Users need clear guidelines on appropriate usage and safe practices to avoid misuse, further supported by documentation on how to safely handle AI capabilities.

- **Technical Q:** What runs locally, and what relies on internet connectivity in this context?

  The vision server operates locally, utilizing basic math and Python libraries to quickly detect objects on the screen. It is capable of identifying multiple objects simultaneously, displaying these detections in real time.

  In the early stages of the current plugin, an empty/full trash bin image was employed to showcase some of these capabilities. Each detection inherits its name from the file name, commonly referred to in the code as templates. The detections are assigned a confidence percentage ranging from 0 to 100%, with a threshold of approximately 90% to ensure that only valid detections are displayed.

  Each detection also contains its screen position, currently limited to the primary screen. As it stands, the system is designed to work optimally with 1920x1080 resolution displays, unless specifically hard-coded to accommodate other resolutions, or through Electron's `screen` library.

- **Operational Limits and Local Usage:**  
  **Problem:** The vision server primarily runs locally, ensuring quick response times and offline functionality. However, we are risking local misuse.
  **Solution:**  
  - **Local Access Limits:** Enforce boundaries on what the system can access based on a whitelist of approved applications.

- **Example Major Challenge:** Preventing usage in games.

To address this, the software can implement mechanisms to automatically disable the vision server while games are active and fully turn it off during game play. This ensures that the user experience in competitive environments is not compromised while maintaining the integrity of the vision server's functionality. Many competitive games require high frames per second (FPS), but the current software can only detect changes every 0.4 to 0.6 seconds, which is insufficient for the 60 FPS that gamers typically seek.

- **Game Interaction Prevention:**  
  **Problem:** If the system is used within gaming contexts, it could unintentionally interfere with the user experience or compromise fair game play.
  **Solution:**
  - **Detection and Deactivation During Games:** Implement automatic recognition of active games, temporarily disabling the vision server to avoid interference.
  - **Performance-Based Thresholds:** Establishing detection speed limits (e.g., limiting to non-gaming FPS) to avoid tampering with game performance or frame rates, ensuring fair play.
  - **User Confirmation for AI Actions:** Requiring user consent for each action the AI takes helps maintain control.

- **Example Major Challenge:** Preventing training of bots.

- **Avoiding Bot Training or Exploitation:**  
  **Problem:** The AI's interaction capabilities could inadvertently be used to train automated bots, potentially enabling malicious actions.
  **Solution:**  
  - **Prompt Filters and Limited Repetition:** Integrate response filters to prevent repetitive bot-like interactions, coupled with warnings for repeated attempts.
  - **Context-Aware AI Responses:** Train the AI to recognize tasks that might contribute to bot training, rejecting such requests or requiring user rationale for performing repetitive tasks.
  - **User Confirmation for AI Actions:** Requiring user consent for each action the AI takes helps maintain control.

- **Example Major Challenge:** Preventing training of human faces.

The current algorithm is good at detecting static images with exact match and there is no way to train a specific image so it can be found on moving pictures or in frames without the exact pixel colors, so this at the current stage is no where near good enough for performing this task, and should only be used to interact with basic UI elements that otherwise were impossible to interact with code

- **Human Face and Sensitive Image Detection Controls:**  
  **Problem:** While the vision server performs well with exact image matching, adapting it to general image patterns (like face detection) introduces privacy risks.
  **Solution:**  
  - **Static Image Restriction:** Limit detection to non-unique, non-sensitive UI elements to avoid issues tied to human identity or sensitive content.
  - **Mandatory Consent for Detection Models:** Require user permissions for any detection attempts related to human faces or sensitive images, ensuring compliance with privacy norms.

- **Example Major Challenge:** Protecting confidential interfaces from unauthorized AI interaction.

- **Secure Handling of Confidential Interfaces:**
  - **Problem:** When the AI encounters sensitive or confidential interfaces, it risks unintentionally revealing or interacting with protected information, compromising security.
  - **Solution:**  
    - **Environment-Specific Profiles:** Users can create profiles that restrict AI access to certain apps or screens, ensuring a secure workspace for confidential information.
    - **Defined Confidentiality Controls:** Sensitive systems can be designated as undetectable, preventing AI interaction with restricted screens or applications. Core plugins with shared functionality across the system will only interact with official, tested plugins available in the store, reinforcing security and trust.

### User Responsibility and Safety

While technical solutions are essential, user responsibility plays a key role in maintaining a safe environment for these tools. Educating users and fostering a culture of responsible usage can help mitigate many potential risks.

- **User Awareness and Responsibility:**  
  Users need to understand that this tool, while powerful, carries inherent risks. Clear communication about responsible use, coupled with periodic reminders about safe practices, can help maintain a high standard of ethical usage. This tool is simply a means to an end, it can be used for both positive and negative purposes, and it is ultimately up to the user to decide how they will use it.

- **Permissions and Skill Requirements:**  
  The AI should inform users of any actions it intends to take, **requiring confirmation for specific tasks.** This process supports transparency, helping users make informed decisions. Additionally, users may need a working knowledge of programming basics, as this tool requires some understanding of how commands interact with the system.

### Additional Major Challenges to Address

Here are more potential challenges that may require solutions:

1. **Proactive Refusal of Unethical Requests:**  
  Program the AI to decline potentially unethical or harmful requests while explaining the reasoning. This refusal should be rooted in a well-defined ethical framework, ensuring the AI's responses align with safety guidelines.

2. **Scalable Ethical Safeguards:**  
  Integrate a scalable model for ethical oversight that evolves with emerging risks. This system should actively adapt to new ethical challenges, incorporating feedback and adjustments over time.

3. **Guardrails Against AI Misinterpretation:**  
  The AI must correctly interpret user commands to prevent unintended actions. Implement safeguards to clarify user intentions before performing critical actions, especially where there is room for ambiguity.

4. **Real-Time User Feedback Loops:**  
  Allow the AI to ask for feedback on its actions in real time, providing users with ongoing influence over the system's behavior and responses.

5. **Community and Regulatory Compliance:**  
  Stay ahead of industry standards and regulatory requirements, adjusting the AI's capabilities and limits as necessary to maintain compliance. This includes adhering to privacy laws, data usage restrictions, and AI ethics standards.

## Simulated Conversations

My app prioritizes ethical considerations and user accountability. By integrating boundaries, permissions, and guidance into each interaction, the AI can foster a safe environment while providing flexibility for legitimate, responsible use cases. The conversational examples below illustrate how the AI will not only upholds these values but actively guides users toward secure practices and respectful use of automation.

This framework emphasizes transparency, user accountability, and the proactive refusal of tasks that fall outside ethical use.

In tackling these challenges, here's an example exchange that highlights the AI's safety-conscious design and its focus on ethical considerations:

---

- **Why is this useful?**

  Imagine telling your computer to click a button, and it responds by moving the mouse, learning from the context if necessary, and performing the click action.

- **Awesome! But this is why we can't have good things. This could lead to many unwanted behaviors.**

  Exactly. So, how can we program the computer to refuse to execute harmful commands?

- **That's a good idea, but even with safeguards in place, people will always find ways to bypass them, especially with local LLMs.**

  True. Local LLMs often take too long to load anyway, so let's set them aside for now. We still face the same underlying problem.

---

**User:** "Can you interact with any app on my screen?"  
**AI:** "I'm set up to help with general applications and common workflows. For sensitive applications, like banking or health data, I need explicit permission each time. This way, I can ensure both privacy and security are maintained."

---

**User:** "I want you to detect and highlight every instance of a face in this folder."  
**AI:** "While I can locate distinct objects, identifying and handling faces involves additional ethical and privacy considerations. Could we discuss the intended use to ensure alignment with privacy guidelines?"

---

**User:** "Can you perform repetitive clicks for a game I play?"  
**AI:** "I'm actually designed to avoid interactions within gaming environments, especially competitive games, to promote fair play. Would you like to automate a different, non-gaming task instead?"

---

**User:** "Can you help me log into my accounts faster by clicking the password fields automatically?"  
**AI:** "I can assist with general navigation, but handling sensitive fields like passwords requires a direct action from you each time. This is for added security so that only you control access to those fields."

---

**User:** "Can I train you to recognize people's faces or specific items in real-time video?"  
**AI:** "At this stage, my design is optimized for detecting simpler, static images and objects, and I avoid tasks involving real-time personal identifiers like faces. This helps prevent misuse and keeps interactions ethical and secure."

---

**User:** "Can you detect when I'm in a meeting app so I don't miss notifications?"  
**AI:** "Absolutely, I can help manage notifications when certain applications are active. I avoid directly interacting with any of the meeting contents, though, to maintain the privacy of your workspace."

---

**User:** "Can I use you to help me monitor other people's actions on my computer?"  
**AI:** "My design is centered around assisting you with personal tasks. Monitoring other users can raise privacy issues, so I'm set up to restrict any actions that could affect other individuals' data or workspace."

---

**User:** "What about making sure certain apps don't open if a particular image is detected?"  
**AI:** "That's a helpful idea, especially if you want to avoid distractions or limit access to certain applications based on visual cues. I'd be happy to discuss setting up responsible guidelines for when to allow or block apps."

---

**User:** "Can you scan every window on my screen for certain text?"  
**AI:** "I can assist in monitoring specific applications where you provide explicit permissions, but I'm designed to avoid scanning all open windows. This keeps your workspace focused and avoids unnecessary access."

---

**User:** "Can you help track the movements on my screen for creating an analysis report?"  
**AI:** "I can help you analyze certain workflows if they're part of personal productivity efforts. However, my monitoring scope is limited to prevent misuse, especially if it involves tracking third-party actions."

---

**User:** "What if I want you to automate tasks that involve confidential documents?"  
**AI:** "For tasks with confidential materials, I require additional permissions to ensure any actions comply with privacy safeguards. You're in control of how these documents are handled, and I'm here to support careful, secure workflows."

**User:** "Can you interact with any app on my screen?"  
**AI:** "Currently, I can interact with general applications, but I avoid high-risk or confidential interfaces unless explicit permission is granted. This helps protect both your privacy and security."  

**User:** "I need you to perform repetitive clicks for a game."  
**AI:** "Unfortunately, I'm designed to avoid interaction within gaming contexts to ensure fair play and prevent unintended interference. Is there something else I can assist you with?"

## How do we prevent misuse while maintaining usability?

We need to explore advanced moderation techniques, possibly incorporating real-time analysis of commands issued to the system. Utilizing a whitelist of acceptable commands or integrating machine learning models trained on ethical behavior might be viable solutions. Additionally, creating an interactive feedback loop where the system learns from user behavior can help in identifying and rejecting potentially harmful requests.

It's crucial to foster a safe and secure environment that empowers users while safeguarding against misuse. Continuous improvement and community feedback will be essential as we navigate this complex landscape.
